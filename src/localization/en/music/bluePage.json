  "blueDescOne": "The phrase \"feeling blue\", meaning sadness and melancholy, appears in countless songs—from classic blues to modern pop music. But why did the color blue become a symbol of sorrow in English-speaking culture?",
  "blueDescTwo": "One theory about its origin comes from maritime traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries. When a ship lost its captain or an important crew member, sailors would raise blue flags as a sign of mourning. Ships returning to port empty-handed or after an unsuccessful voyage would also hoist blue signals, symbolizing disappointment and loss.",
  "blueDescThree": "Later, this expression made its way into art, especially music. In the early 20th century, the United States saw the rise of a musical genre called blues, where artists sang about heartbreak, loss, and loneliness. The name blues itself comes from the phrase \"blue devils,\" an old English slang term for deep sadness. This cemented the association between the color blue and melancholy in musical culture.",
  "blueDescFour": "Today, \"feeling blue\" can be heard in hundreds of songs—from Ella Fitzgerald to Billie Eilish. For centuries, musicians have captured in their songs the same sorrow that sailors once felt as they gazed out at the endless blue ocean."
